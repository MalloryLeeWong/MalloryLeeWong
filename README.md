# Hi, I'm Mallory 👋

I'm a software engineer working across the full stack. I especially enjoy bringing designs to life on the front-end, finding ways to delight users, and collaborating on technology strategy. Some technologies I enjoy working with include JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Node.js.
