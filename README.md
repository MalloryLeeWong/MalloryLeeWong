# Hi, I'm Mallory 👋

I'm a software engineer building across the full stack. I especially enjoy bringing designs to life on the front-end, delighting end-users, collaborating on technology strategy, and finding ways to improve the developer experience. Some technologies I currently enjoy working with include JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, and TailwindCSS.
